The work of this algorithms is designed in 2 separate files.
For each algorithms we will be able to check the path the algorthm follows based on predesigned nodes.
And the second way is to give the nodes as input by clicking the GRID and then the algorithm will draw the generated path based on input nodes.

On case of the user_control files we can use right click mouse to give to new nodes.
